# **Introduction**

PEP8: the objective of this task is to learn the importance of using PEP8 in our code and to practice with tools like linters: Flake8 and Pycodestyle, and formatters: Black and Autopep8.

# **Execution instructions**

* This activity has two files: the before_pep8.py has code that does't follow PEP8 and the after_pep8.py contains the code using best practices.
* All the activities from this repo were checked taking into account PEP8.
