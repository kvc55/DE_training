# **Introduction**

DataBase access: the aim of this task is to access databases through ORM (Object Relational Mapper) using SQLAlchemy, PostgresSQL and pgAdmin4.

# **Execution instructions**

## **Configure the connection to the database**

Create a .ini or .env file configuring the data connection:

    DB_USERNAME = my_user_name
    DB_PASSWORD = my_password
    DB_HOST = host
    DB_PORT = port
    DB_NAME = my_database

## **Create DB and customer table**

Use the customer.sql file inside the resources folder and import it into pgAdmin4 to create the database and the table that is used for this activity.

## **You can execute the activity by running**

    python database.py

inside the source folder

## **Documentation**
